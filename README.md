# Centralized-PHC-Monitoring-and-Management-System

The Centralized PHC Monitoring and Management System is an advanced healthcare solution designed to optimize the operations of Primary Health Centers (PHCs), Upgraded PHCs, and Subcenters by integrating them with the District Deputy Director of Health Services (DDHS) for real-time monitoring. The system leverages machine learning, automation, and data analytics to enhance healthcare efficiency, accountability, and transparency. One of its key features is facial recognition-based doctor attendance tracking, ensuring accurate attendance records while generating automated absenteeism alerts to prevent workforce shortages. Additionally, the system enables real-time patient record management, maintaining comprehensive patient details, treatments, and diagnoses. These records are automatically analyzed and presented in graphical formats, allowing healthcare administrators to track trends and make informed decisions.
To enhance operational efficiency, the system automates daily and monthly report generation, sending structured reports in CSV format to the DDHS. A crucial component is the anomaly detection mechanism, which identifies sudden fluctuations in patient numbers at PHCs and immediately notifies healthcare officials for prompt action. This feature helps in resource allocation, emergency handling, and service optimization. By integrating advanced facial recognition, automated alerts, centralized data management, and anomaly detection, this system revolutionizes healthcare monitoring, improves service delivery, and strengthens decision-making processes in PHCs. It reduces manual workload, ensures real-time updates, and fosters a data-driven healthcare approach, ultimately enhancing patient care and healthcare administration.
